You probably think YAML stands for "Yet Another Markup Language". It ain't! YAML is really a data serialization language. But if you want to think of it as a markup, that's OK with me. A lot of people try to use XML as a serialization format.

"YAML" is catchy and fun to say. Try it. "YAML, YAML, YAML!!!"
...

# Dump the Perl data structures back into YAML.
print Dump($string,$arrayref,$hashref);

print "------\n";
print "------\n";
# YAML::Dump is used the same way you'd use Data::Dumper::Dumper
use Data::Dumper;
print Dumper($string,$arrayref,$hashref);
